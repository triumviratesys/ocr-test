# Enable Billing for Google Cloud Vision API

## Don't Worry - You Won't Be Charged!

Google requires a billing account for Cloud Vision API, but:
- ✅ **First 1000 requests/month = FREE forever**
- ✅ **No automatic charges** - you control spending limits
- ✅ **No surprises** - clear pricing after free tier
- ✅ **Cancel anytime**

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Billing
**Direct Link**: https://console.developers.google.com/billing/enable?project=950676763645

Or manually:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing
2. Click **"Link a Billing Account"** or **"Create Billing Account"**

### Step 2: Create Billing Account
1. Enter your billing information (credit card required)
2. **Google gives you $300 in free credits** for new accounts!
3. Accept the terms
4. Click "Start my free trial"

### Step 3: Wait a Few Minutes
- It takes 2-5 minutes for billing to activate
- You'll get an email confirmation when ready

### Step 4: Test Your OCR
After billing is enabled, try uploading an image again through your web interface.

## Cost Breakdown

### What's FREE:
- **First 1000 requests per month** = $0
- This resets every month

### After 1000 requests:
- $1.50 per 1000 requests
- **Example**: 5000 requests/month = FREE (first 1000) + $6 (next 4000) = **$6/month total**

### Setting Spending Limits:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/budgets
2. Click "Create Budget"
3. Set alert at $5, $10, etc.
4. You'll get email notifications

## Alternatives If You Don't Want to Enable Billing

If you really don't want to add a credit card, here are alternatives:

### Option 1: Use OCR.space API (Free Tier)
- 25,000 requests/month free
- **But**: Max 1MB file size (won't work for your large images)

### Option 2: Use Microsoft Azure Computer Vision
- 5000 requests/month free
- **But**: Also requires credit card for verification

### Option 3: Use Tesseract.js (Offline)
- Unlimited free usage
- **But**: Lower accuracy than cloud services

## Recommendation

**Just enable billing with Google!** Here's why:
1. $300 free credit for new accounts
2. 1000 free requests/month forever
3. Best OCR accuracy available
4. Handles large files (20MB)
5. No practical cost for personal use

Most users never exceed the free tier unless running a production app with thousands of users.

## Security Note

Google will never charge you without:
1. You explicitly exceeding the free tier
2. Getting notifications about usage
3. Having set up billing limits (optional but recommended)

## Need Help?

If you don't want to enable billing, let me know and I can:
1. Switch you to a different OCR service
2. Set up Tesseract.js for offline OCR
3. Help you find other alternatives
